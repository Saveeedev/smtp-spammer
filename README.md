# smtp-spammer
New version of my MailerJS, you can use that for email campaign.

# How it works
Put your mailist on the "victims.txt" file.
Then, check the "configuration.json" file to edit all data (smtp host, sender, ...)
Finaly, include your html code in the "scama.html" file.

# LAUNCH IT !
start the file with : node spammerz.js
(Assure you install all libraries)
